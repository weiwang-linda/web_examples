		<h1>Different types of selector</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Simple selectors</li>
			<p>Match one or more elements based on element type, class, or id.</p>

			</ul>
			<li>Pseudo-classes</li>
			<p>A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword preceded by a colon(:) that is added on to the end of selectors to specify that you want to style the selected elements only when they are in certain state. For example you might want to style an element only when it is being hovered over by the mouse pointer, or a checkbox when it is disabled or checked, or an element that is the first child of its parent in the DOM tree</p>
			<a href="pseudo_class.html">Pseudo-classes example</a>
			<li>Pseudo-elements</li>
			<p>Pseudo-elements are very much like pseudo-classes.They are keywords - this time preceded by two colons(::) - that can be added to the end of selectors to select a certain part of an element.</p>

			<li>Combinators</li>
			<p>CSS selectors become even more useful when you start combining them to perform fine-grained selections. Based on how they are related to one another.Those relationships are expressed with combinators as follows.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A,B</li>
				<li>A B</li>
				<li>A > B</li>
				<li>A + B</li>
				<li>A ~ B</li>
			</ul>
			<a href="combinators_table.html">Combinators table example</a>
			<li>Multiple selectors</li>
			<p>You can write multiple selectors separated by commas, to apply the same rule to multiple sets of selected elements at once.<p>
