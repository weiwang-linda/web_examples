		<h2>Definition</h2>
		<p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages.It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies</p>
		<a href="js_first_example.html">The first js example</a>

		<h2>What can it really do</h2>
		<p>The core JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>store useful values inside variables</li>
			<li>Operations on pieces of text(known as "strings" in programming).</li>
			<li>Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. </li>
			<li>And much more!</li>
		</ul>
		<p>APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement. They generally fall into two categories. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Browser APIs are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment, or do useful complex things. </li>
			<ol>
				<li>The DOM (Document Object Model) API: allows you to manipulate HTML and CSS, creating, removing and changing HTML, dynamically applying new styles to your page, etc. </li>
				<li>The Geolocation API: retrieves geographical information.</li>
				<li>The Canvas and WebGL APIs: allow you to create animated 2D and 3D graphics. </li>
				<li>Audio and Video APIs: like HTMLMediaElement and WebRTC allow you to do really interesting things with multimedia, such as play audio and video right in a web page, or grab video from your web camera and display it on someone else's computer</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Third party APIs are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to grab their code and information from somewhere on the Web. </li>
			<ol>
				<li>The Twitter API: allows you to do things like displaying your latest tweets on your website.</li>
				<li>The Google Maps API: allows you to embed custom maps into your website, and other such functionality.</li>
			</ol>
		</ul>

		<h2>What is JavaScript doing on your page?</h2>
		<p>When you load a web page in your browser, you are running your code (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) inside an execution environment (the browser tab). This is like a factory that takes in raw materials (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).</p>
		<p>The JavaScript is executed by the browser's JavaScript engine, after the HTML and CSS have been assembled and put together into a web page. </p>

		<h3>JavaScript running order</h3>
		<p>When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs it in order, from top to bottom. This means that you need to be careful what order you put things in. </p>
		
		<h3>Server-side versus client-side code</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Client-side code</li>
			<p>is code that is run on the user's computer — when a web page is viewed, the page's client-side code is downloaded, then run and displayed by the browser. </p>
			<li>Server-side code</li>
			<p>on the other hand is run on the server, then its results are downloaded and displayed in the browser. JavaScript can also be used as a server-side language, for example in the popular Node.js environmen</p>
		</ul>
		<p>The word dynamic is used to describe both client-side JavaScript, and server-side languages — it refers to the ability to update the display of a web page/app to show different things in different circumstances, generating new content as required. Server-side code dynamically generates new content on the server, e.g. pulling data from a database, whereas client-side JavaScript dynamically generates new content inside the browser on the client, e.g. creating a new HTML table, inserting data requested from the server into it, then displaying the table in a web page shown to the user. The meaning is slightly different in the two contexts, but related, and both approaches (server-side and client-side) usually work together.</p>

		<h2>How do you add JavaScript to your page?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>internal javascript</li>
			<p>go to your text editor and add the &lt;script&gt; and &lt;/scrpit&gt; just before your closing &lt;/body&gt;</p>
			<a href="button_click_js.html">Javascript example: button click</a>
			<li>External JavaScript</li>
			<p>First, create a new file in the same directory as your sample HTML file.</p>
			<p>Next, write all of the script out of your current element into the .js file. Save that file.</p>
			<p>Now, insert &lt;script&gt; element with "src=path of js file" attribute.</p>
			<li>Inline JavaScript handlers</li>
			<p>sometimes you'll come across bits of actual JavaScript code living inside HTML. Some elements includes an inline onclick handler to make the function run when the button is pressed. It is bad practice to pollute your HTML with JavaScript. </p>
		</ul>

		<h2>Comments</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>A single line comment is written after a double forward slash</li>
			<li>A multi-line comment is written between the strings /* and */</li>
		</ul>
