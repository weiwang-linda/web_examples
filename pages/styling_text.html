		<h1>Styling text in CSS</h1>
		<p>The CSS properties used to style text generally fall into two categories</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Font styles: family, size...</li>
			<li>Text layout styles: text align, line space</li>
		</ul>

		<div>
		<h1>Tommy the cat</h1>

		<p>I remember as if it were a meal ago...</p>

		<p>Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
		 may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat 
		 had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
		  this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban 
		  predator â€” Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare 
		  occasion such as this that he did.</p>
